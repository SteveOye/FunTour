    <string name="location_detail">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry\'s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a
        galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
        It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
        remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
        containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
        and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</string>

    <string name="info">The late 18th century saw the nationalisation of royal or princely art
        collections across mainland Europe. The Bavarian royal collection (now in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich)
        opened to the public in 1779, that of the Medici in Florence around 1789 (as the Uffizi Gallery),
        and the Museum Français at the Louvre was formed out of the former French royal collection in 1793.[8] Great Britain,
        however, did not emulate the continental model, and the British Royal Collection remains in the sovereigns possession today.
        In 1777 the British government had the opportunity to buy an art collection of international stature,
        when the descendants of Sir Robert Walpole put his collection up for sale. The MP John Wilkes argued for the government
        to buy this "invaluable treasure" and suggested that it be housed in "a noble gallery… to be built in the spacious garden
        of the British Museum"[9] Nothing came of Wilkes's appeal and 20 years later the collection
        was bought in its entirety by Catherine the Great; it is now to be found in the State Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg.</string>
